		<h2 class="heading-medium margin-bottom-xs">Hello, again!</h2>
		<p>Last year, with the help of your support and donations, I played video games for 34 hours, raising $618.19 for <a href="http://www.childrens-specialized.org/">Children's Specialized Hospital</a>. And our team, <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=30382">Team #KnifeShoes</a>, raised a total of $3,297 for hospitals in the Children's Miracle Network.</p>
		<p>It was incredible. You were incredible. And I'm proud to be back for Extra Life 2016!</p>

		<h2 class="heading-medium margin-bottom-xs">So, wait, what's Extra Life?</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.extra-life.org">Extra Life</a> is a 24-hour video game marathon that raises money to help sick kids. But we need your help.</p>
		<h2 class="heading-medium margin-bottom-xs">Me? How can I help?</h2>
		<p>The quickest way is to <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donate.participant&participantID=220251">click here</a> and make a donation to the Children's Specialized Hospital. (It's tax-deductible!) My personal goal this year is to raise $250 before the end of my 24 hour marathon, and I'd appreciate any help you can give those kids.</p>
		<p>I'll be enduring mild discomfort for a great cause, and you get to feel like a hero - it's win/win.</p>
		<h2 class="heading-medium margin-bottom-xs">Is there anything else I can do?</h2>
		<p>Of course. You can share the link to my donation page via social media, tell your friends and family about Extra Life, or cheer me on during the marathon.</p>

		<p>I'm thankful for anything you can do to raise awareness of this awesome cause.</p>
		<h2 class="heading-medium margin-bottom-xs">When is it?</h2>
		<p>It is <strong>Saturday, November 5th</strong>. I'll be starting the marathon at 8am Eastern Time, playing for 24 hours straight, until Sunday at 8am. But you can donate whenever.</p>
		<h2 class="heading-medium margin-bottom-xs">Will you do anything if I donate?</h2>
		<p>Uh, yeah! If you make a donation, I'll thank you via Facebook and Twitter during the marathon (if you want). And if you like, you can offer requests for me to do something special during the marathon.</p>
		<p>You can make requests, and if I have it, I'll play it.<br>Need me to be your healer in Overwatch? I'm there.<br>I can talk like I'm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkze_IBWN46Gh0SQ1mIBf42yWj64b3ttE">on a podcast</a>.<br>Or I can tell you all about how awesome you are.<br>I've got 24 hours to fill, and as I proved in the previous years, I'll do pretty much anything within my power to help.</p>
		<h2 class="heading-medium margin-bottom-xs">What if you beat your goal?</h2>
		<p>Last year, I said that for every $50 I raised beyond my goal, I'd play for an extra hour during the weekend. This year, I'll make it a lot more simple:</p>
		<p><strong>If we beat my donation goal of $250, I will play for an extra half-marathon on Sunday, November 6th.</strong></p>
		<p>Yeah, that's 36 hours in two days - as long as we beat that goal. So, let's do it! Make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh1UXi0csqc&feature=youtu.be">Jeremy Bentham's stuffed corpse</a> proud by making your friend suffer for the great good.</p>
		<h2 class="heading-medium margin-bottom-xs">One last question - how can I follow along?</h2>
		<p>Like last year, I'll be streaming most of my marathon on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/pfcballs/">Twitch</a>, with interludes of Google Hangout (viewed via YouTube). And you can also keep track of me throughout the day on <a href="https://twitter.com/joeyheflich">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosmicpessimist/">Instagram</a>, where I'll be sharing updates about my progress.</p>
		<p>So, please, if you can, make a donation to Extra Life and help me help you help some sick kids.</p>
