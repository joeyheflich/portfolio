			<p class="project-copy">In the summer of 2016, I worked with the Youth Outlook team to create a custom Wordpress theme and related custom plugins in order to update the functionality of their site, make it a responsive experience and to give it a look and feel that better represented their organization. The key challenge for the project was to make something that conveyed their message and looked great on the front-end, but was also straightforward for non-technical contributors and volunteers to use in the back-end. With the help of feedback from the team, I designed a series of custom templates to be used with a variety of plugins, so that they can quickly and easily update everything without ever having to see an HTML tag.</p>

			<p class="project-copy">One of the best parts of my job is that I get to work with Erin DeMoss. Once she decided to move away from Squarespace for her personal portfolio, Erin sent me a .PSD and asked me to build her a Wordpress website that could change and grow with her needs. The basic theme was completed in a few days, thanks to modern development tools like Sass, Bower and Gulp, and we planned out how to incrementally update the site's functionality in the future. That way, when she needs to make a change, I can get a mock-up from her, code the tweaks, push them to our test environment for approval and deploy to the live version of her site, without any rigmarole.</p>

			<h2 class="project-title heading-medium">King Bone Press</h2>
			<p class="project-copy">The third in a series of major site launches for King Bone Press, the new website was made with two things in mind - making it easier to update, and refreshing the look while sticking to the company's indie/punk rock style. Taking what I learned from working with Woocommerce in the past, I incorporated modified custom post types and taxonomies to manage the series, comics and creator data, to significantly cut down on the time it takes to pull in content from their sales partners. And since most of the back-end changes were implemented via a combination of custom and open-source plugins, it's more secure and easier to maintain than ever.</p>

			<p class="project-copy">An incredibly fun project with a wonderful guy. Jon asked me to create a custom Wordpress theme for his video game blog that could visually combine his love of old school game consoles with my minimalist style. The clean, retro design was optimized to look great across desktop, mobile and tablet screens, with console-specific colors used to categorize each post so that they'd pop out at you as you scroll down through the articles. </p>

Rob didn't know exactly what he wanted before our first meeting, but by the end of the research phase, I was able to work with him to hone in on exactly what worked best for him - a light, simple look complimented with three colors taken from his artwork that would represent each of section of his site. It was a mobile-friendly, progressively-enhanced success.</p>

			<p class="project-copy">In the summer of 2015, I worked with representatives from CFED and Citi to develop a child theme, based on Divi, to help simplify the site and make it a more responsive, modern experience. We performed a content audit, improved on the Wordpress back-end to make it easier for the team to update and developed a new custom post-type for the site, Stories, to present recent, important work done by ABPN. The redesign took into consideration potential needs of users and the various upgrades requested while sticking with the requirement to keep the site's look and feel similar to the pre-existing design. </p>

			<p class="project-copy">One of my favorite projects. It was originally a small site that allowed me to make something with Bootstrap, but in time, it grew into an invaluable promotional asset for the comic. I was able to get updates and art from Natasha, sketch out changes and improve on the design throughout her Kickstarter campaign and the months after. What I learned (and disliked) about that framework has shaped my development process ever since.</p>

I worked with him to create a Wordpress theme that was straight to the point - just art, no complications.</p>

			<p class="project-copy">The guys at King Bone Press were so pleased with their main site, I got a chance to work with them again a few months later in 2014 on their web comic, World's Strongest Mailman. I came up with a new logo, built a custom Wordpress theme from scratch and converted the existing archive from ComicPress. The goal was to design something that looked great on tablets and phones, so that fans could go through 150+ pages of the comic, anywhere, anytime. The finished responsive theme hit the mark for them, with a clean, modern look that had just enough personality to frame the wacky adventures of Svend the Mailman.</p>
