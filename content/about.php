		<h1 class="intro-title">About Me</h1>
		<p>There's more than one meditation app on my phone. Sublime Text is my favorite editor. Cleaning up my podcast subscriptions list is a monthly chore. Savory tastes better than sweet. Keynes over Hayek. Most of what I do happens around my laptop. Still scared of writing unmaintainable code. And I haven't been to space (yet).</p>

		<p>I'm Joey, and this is my About Me Page.</p>

			<p class="process-copy">Developing a great project document means doing our homework. I'll spend as much time as possible talking with you and your team, along with reviewing your existing content and learning about what you do. The more I discover about your organization, your message and your audience, the better I'll be able to help with your needs.</p>
			<p class="process-copy">And I think we'd all be a lot happier if I knew about that thing you absolutely hate that you never, ever want to see on your website before I put fingers to keyboard.</p>

			<p class="process-copy">Our goals are clear, and it's time for me to sketch and make wireframes to get feedback on what I learned during research. If the schedule allows for it, I'll create static mockups to get approval on look and feel, but the key part of this step is creating an in-browser mockup with your site content. That way, you and your team can provide feedback on a real website viewed on actual devices, and I can work with your content creators to craft a better user experience. </p>
			<p class="process-copy">Plus, we get to do that thing where we resize the browser window back and forth, hypnotized by the wonders of responsive design.</p>

			<p class="process-copy">Once the architecture, layout and aesthetics are locked in, I focus on creating templates, forms, widgets, custom functionality and back-end customizations. We'll check our progress against the needs and wants established in the Planning and Research steps, to make sure that what I'm coding stays within scope while accomplishing our goals.</p>
			<p class="process-copy">For projects using Wordpress, I'll set up a test install as a staging area for launch, allowing everyone on the team the time to get comfortable with the CMS. That also means that we can collaborate as I push updates to the theme, so I can add little custom fixes and help text in the back-end requested by you and your team.</p>

			<h2 class="process-title heading-medium">Testing and Training</h2>
			<p class="process-copy">There's no sense in getting a brand new website that you don't know how to update. Which is why I set aside the time to work with you and your team to teach everyone what they need to know about what goes where, which images should be in what aspect ratio and what to do if something breaks. Not only does it help make you more effective at accomplishing your goals once your site goes live, but it provides me valuable feedback on what to tweak, what to simplify and where a little help text can go a long way.</p>
			<p class="process-copy">I also test what we've done together on multiple devices, in all of the popular browsers, to make sure that we catch all of the possible bugs and quirks that pop up during web development. (And for clients that request it, I can test for specific cases, like IE8 compatibility or Opera Mobile users that browse on Android devices made in 2012 while upside down.)</p>

			<p class="process-copy">For you and your team, it's that exciting day when everything goes live. For me, it's the first day of the rest of our working relationship together.</p>
			<p class="process-copy">After I push our completed work out into the world, I run down my launch checklist to make sure that your 301s aren't causing 404s, that the site is responding as quickly as possible and that there were no typos in those last minute changes you made the night before. (Believe me, I know you only needed to change just that one thing that's been bugging you, and I'm here to help.) I'll update your Google Search Console settings, and before the day is over, plan out a post-launch plan to help you with what comes next.</p>
			<p class="process-copy">Whether it's occasionally helping you with minor updates or tracking analytics and making changes to improve your conversion rate, I'll be ready for whatever you need.</p>
